# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment by making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone,<br>
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,<br>
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.<br>

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior.<br>
They are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.<br>

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,<br>
and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.<br>
They also have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.<br>

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces,<br>
and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.<br>

Examples of representing our project or community include using an official project e-mail address,<br>
posting via an official social media account,<br>
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.<br>

Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.<br>

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at mary.lv416e@gmail.com.<br>
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.<br>

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the confidentiality of the reporter of an incident.<br>
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.<br>

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith<br>
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.<br>
