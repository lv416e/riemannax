## Introduction

Strategic expansion of RiemannAX's manifold library to establish competitive advantage in the rapidly growing computer vision and robotics markets. Implementation of hyperbolic manifolds (Poincaré Ball, Lorentz model) and SE(3) Lie groups positions RiemannAX as the leading library for geometric deep learning and robotics applications in the JAX ecosystem.

This feature addresses critical market gaps that Pymanopt and Geoopt cannot fill, accelerating RiemannAX adoption in the explosive hyperbolic learning field and robotics applications that have emerged in 2024.
