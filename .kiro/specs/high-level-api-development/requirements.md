# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the development of production-ready, high-level APIs for RiemannAX that provide scikit-learn compatible interfaces, practical problem templates, and seamless integration with the JAX machine learning ecosystem. The goal is to bridge the gap between RiemannAX's powerful low-level manifold optimization capabilities and practical, everyday machine learning workflows.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a Riemannian optimizer with string manifold specification THEN RiemannAX SHALL provide a constructor interface accepting manifold type as string parameter (e.g., `RiemannianSGD(manifold="sphere", lr=0.01)`)

2. WHEN a user calls `fit(objective_func, initial_point)` on a Riemannian optimizer THEN RiemannAX SHALL execute optimization and return a result object containing the optimized parameters, convergence status, and optimization metadata

3. WHEN a user accesses optimizer parameters THEN RiemannAX SHALL provide `get_params()` and `set_params(**params)` methods following scikit-learn estimator interface conventions

4. IF a user provides invalid manifold specification THEN RiemannAX SHALL raise a descriptive ValueError with available manifold options

5. WHEN optimization completes THEN RiemannAX SHALL return results in a standardized format with attributes for optimized parameters, final objective value, iteration count, and convergence flag

### Requirement 2: Automatic Manifold Detection API
**Objective:** As a machine learning researcher, I want RiemannAX to automatically detect appropriate manifolds based on parameter structure, so that I can focus on problem formulation rather than manifold selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. IF the initial point is an orthogonal matrix THEN RiemannAX SHALL automatically select the Stiefel manifold with appropriate dimensions

4. IF the initial point is a symmetric positive definite matrix THEN RiemannAX SHALL automatically select the SPD manifold

5. WHEN automatic detection cannot determine a unique manifold THEN RiemannAX SHALL raise an informative error suggesting explicit manifold specification

6. WHEN automatic detection succeeds THEN RiemannAX SHALL log the selected manifold type for user awareness

### Requirement 3: Practical Problem Templates
**Objective:** As a data scientist, I want ready-to-use implementations for common manifold optimization problems, so that I can solve real-world problems without implementing complex manifold operations from scratch.
