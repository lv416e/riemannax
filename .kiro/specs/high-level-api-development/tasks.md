The framework ensures all optimizer instances follow consistent parameter validation and error reporting patterns.

#### [x] 1.2 Automatic Manifold Detection System

## Implementation Notes

### Development Sequence
1. **Phase 1** (Tasks 1.1-1.4): Establish core infrastructure and interfaces
2. **Phase 2** (Tasks 2.1-2.3): Build integration layers with external libraries
3. **Phase 3** (Tasks 3.1-3.4): Implement practical problem templates
4. **Phase 4** (Tasks 4.1-4.4): Optimize performance and hardware utilization
5. **Phase 5** (Tasks 5.1-5.4): Complete documentation and user resources

### Dependency Management
- Tasks 2.x depend on completion of 1.1 (base estimator framework)
- Tasks 3.x depend on completion of 1.1 and 1.3 (base framework and error handling)
- Tasks 4.x can be implemented in parallel with 3.x after 1.x completion
- Tasks 5.x should be developed incrementally alongside implementation tasks

### Quality Assurance
Each task must pass all constitutional quality checks before completion:
- `mypy --config-file=pyproject.toml` (zero type errors)
- `pre-commit run --all-files` (zero style/quality issues)
- `ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes` (zero lint issues)
- `pytest` (zero test failures)
