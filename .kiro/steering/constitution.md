# PYTHON DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - NO EXCEPTIONS ALLOWED

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION**: Proceeding to next Todo without ALL quality checks passing is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

## MANDATORY QUALITY CHECKS (ALL MUST PASS)

Execute these commands and ensure ALL show GREEN/PASS status before next Todo:

```bash
1. mypy --config-file=pyproject.toml
2. pre-commit run --all-files
3. ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes
4. pytest
```

**ENFORCEMENT**: Any RED/FAIL status = BLOCKED progression

## INFORMATION QUALITY MANDATE

**REQUIRED**: Use `context7` for precise, research-based implementations
**PROHIBITED**: Guesswork or general knowledge-based coding

## CONSTITUTIONAL EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Research & Information
- Context7: Gather accurate, up-to-date technical information
- Documentation: Verify best practices and current standards
- Edge Cases: Identify potential issues and deprecated features

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Code based on researched information
- Include proper error handling
- Ensure readability and maintainability

### Phase 3: Quality Validation (CONSTITUTIONAL GATE)
1. **MyPy Check**: Type errors = 0
2. **Pre-commit Check**: Style/quality issues = 0
3. **Ruff Check**: Lint issues = 0
4. **Pytest Check**: Failed tests = 0

### Phase 4: Progression Decision
- **ALL GREEN**: Proceed to next Todo
- **ANY RED**: Continue fixing current Todo

## CONSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE

**Technical Debt Elimination**: Zero accumulation at source
**Quality Consistency**: Every change meets professional standards
**Long-term Value**: Maintainable, reliable, scalable codebase
**Team Excellence**: No compromise development culture

## CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY

This law supersedes all other considerations including:
- Time pressures
- Delivery deadlines
- "Quick fix" temptations
- Partial completion acceptance

**QUALITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**

*This constitutional law is automatically applied to all Python development activities.*
*Violation constitutes professional development malpractice.*
