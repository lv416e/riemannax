"""Internal utilities for Riemannian Adam optimizer.

This module provides shared helper functions used by both RiemannianOptaxAdapter
and RiemannianOptimizer to avoid code duplication. These functions implement the
core Adam update logic adapted for Riemannian manifolds.

Note:
    This is an internal module (prefix _) and should not be imported directly by
    end users. It exists solely to share implementation details between the public
    API adapters.

    After moving from x_old to x_new via retraction, the first moment (velocity)
    is transported to the new tangent space. The second moment (variance) is NOT
    transported as it represents coordinate-dependent element-wise variance.

    This follows the approach of geoopt (the reference Riemannian optimization library):
    - First moment m is a tangent vector and should be parallel transported
    - Second moment v contains element-wise variances (coordinate-dependent) and
      should remain in the local coordinate representation

    Args:
        manifold: The Riemannian manifold.
        x_old: Previous point on the manifold.
        x_new: New point on the manifold (after retraction).
        m: First moment estimate (velocity) at x_old.
        v: Second moment estimate (element-wise variance) at x_old.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (m_transported, v) where:
        - m_transported: First moment in tangent space at x_new
        - v: Second moment unchanged (coordinate-dependent state)

    Note:
        The first moment (velocity) is a tangent vector that should be parallel
        transported and projected to correct numerical errors. The second moment
        is NOT transported because it represents coordinate-dependent element-wise
        variance computed via jnp.square(grad), not a geometric tangent vector.
