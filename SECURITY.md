## Reporting a Vulnerability

The RiemannAX project takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do Not Use Public Bug Tracking Systems** - Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or pull requests.

2. **Email Reporting** - Send security-related issues to mary.lv416e@gmail.com. Please include as much detailed information as possible:
   - The nature and type of the vulnerability
   - The complete path where the vulnerability exists
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment

## Processing Procedures

After receiving a security report, our handling process is as follows:

1. We will review your report and determine if additional information is needed.
2. Once the issue is confirmed, we will develop a remediation plan.
3. We will prepare fixes for all affected versions still under support.
4. We will release the fixes and properly document the issue in release notes.

## Disclosure Policy

The timeframe between vulnerability reporting and fix release varies depending on the severity and complexity of the issue. We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt of reports within 24 hours
- Assess the severity and impact within 7 days
- Release fixes as quickly as possible (typically within 30 days)

## Credit

Those who report security vulnerabilities will be acknowledged with attribution if desired after the remediation process is complete.
